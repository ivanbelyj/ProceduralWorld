# Procedural World
The system of procedural generation of a three-dimensional infinite world on Unity. In the current version supports dynamic terrain creation with mountains and plains, biomes, texturing and planting of trees and vegetation, all in runtime. Some generation steps are performed asynchronously without blocking the main thread.
